# Pacman Search Lab

This repository contains my solutions to the Pacman projects, as outlined in the Berkeley CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course for the 2021 Summer session. Through these projects, I have implemented various search algorithms and game-playing agents, demonstrating a deep understanding of AI principles.

## Project 1: Search in Pacman
![Maze Example](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/assets/images/maze.png)

Implemented various search algorithms to navigate Pacman through mazes to reach goals. In particular it focuses on search algorithms, where we have tackled four specific problems:
- **Question 1:** Implemented Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path to a particular point on the Pacman board. [Details](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/project1/#question-1-3-points-finding-a-fixed-food-dot-using-depth-first-search)
- **Question 2:** Utilized Breadth-First Search (BFS) for a more efficient pathfinding solution. [Details](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/project1/#question-2-3-points-breadth-first-search)
- **Question 3:** Adjusted the cost function to accommodate varying costs of actions. [Details](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/project1/#question-3-3-points-varying-the-cost-function)
- **Question 4:** Implemented A* search algorithm to find an optimal path with the least cost. [Details](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/project1/#question-4-3-points-a-search)


## Project 2: Multi-Agent Pacman

The second project introduces the concept of adversarial search, focusing on game theory and strategic decision-making:

- **Question 1:** Developed a Reflex Agent that reacts to game states for immediate decisions. [Details](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/project2/#question-1-4-points-reflex-agent)
- **Question 2:** Implemented the Minimax algorithm to simulate adversarial play between Pacman and ghosts. [Details](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/project2/#question-2-5-points-minimax)
- **Question 3:** Enhanced the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimizing the decision-making process. [Details](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/project2/#question-3-5-points-alpha-beta-pruning)

## What We Learned

Through these projects, I gained insights into algorithmic problem-solving and strategic AI in games. I learned how to apply depth-first, breadth-first, and A* search algorithms for pathfinding and explored adversarial search techniques such as Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning to build competitive game-playing agents.
